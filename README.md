- **User Interface:** An intuitive user interface is included, allowing users to interact with the system, visualize detected ships, and analyze the results. Features may include an interactive map display and image annotations.

### Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow and Keras:** Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras for developing and training deep learning models. These frameworks provide powerful tools for building and deploying machine learning models efficiently.

- **Python:** The entire project is implemented in Python, a versatile and widely used programming language for machine learning and data analysis.

- **Matplotlib and PIL:** Matplotlib and Python Imaging Library (PIL) are used for image visualization and processing. These libraries aid in creating informative visualizations and handling image data effectively.

- **Git and GitHub:** Version control with Git and collaboration through GitHub ensure a structured development process, enabling multiple contributors to work seamlessly on the project.

### Why These Technologies
- **Deep Learning:** Deep learning, particularly CNNs, is well-suited for image recognition tasks. The complexity and variability of ship detection in satellite images make deep learning an ideal choice for this project.

- **Python Ecosystem:** Python offers an extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools for machine learning, making it a preferred language for developing AI applications.

- **Open Source Collaboration:** Leveraging open-source frameworks and platforms like TensorFlow, Keras, and GitHub promotes collaboration, allowing the project to benefit from a wider community of developers and researchers.

- **Scalability:** The use of scalable technologies ensures the project's adaptability to handle large datasets and perform efficiently in real-world applications.

By combining these technologies, the Airbus Ship Detection project aims to provide an effective solution for ship detection in satellite imagery, contributing to advancements in maritime monitoring and related fields.
